# CLAUDE.md — services/risk (Service B)

## Purpose
Risk + Scoring. Owns the semantic rules engine, the Isolation Forest anomaly model, the NetworkX
cross-application graph, trust-score aggregation, and evidence-chain assembly. Produces the final
`PacketDecision` (TrustScore + ordered evidence chain + recommendation) the dashboard renders.

## Key files
- `app/main.py` — FastAPI app. **Phase 0:** `GET /health`, `GET /` only. Phases 2–5 add the rules
  engine, anomaly scoring, graph, and `POST /risk/score` (the main orchestration endpoint).
- `requirements.txt` — Phase 0 scope (`fastapi/uvicorn/pydantic`); scikit-learn + networkx + joblib
  added in Phase 3/5.
- `Dockerfile` — `python:3.11-slim`; build context is the **repo root** so `shared/` is importable.

## How it fits
Receives a packet's forensic + semantic + anomaly analyses and composes the trust score. Calls the
mock adapters in `shared/mocks` (e.g. AIS reported income) for cross-checks. The dashboard calls
`POST /risk/score`.

## Local-only contract
No outbound network calls. External verifications go through `shared/mocks` (local fixtures only).
CORS opened only for `http://localhost:5173`.

## How to run / test just this part
```bash
# from the repo root (so `shared` resolves)
uvicorn services.risk.app.main:app --reload --port 8002
curl http://localhost:8002/health        # -> {"status":"ok","service":"risk",...}
# or via Docker:  docker compose up risk
```

## Gotchas
- Run from the **repo root** (PYTHONPATH) or shared imports fail; in Docker this is `/app`.
- Scoring weights/thresholds must be explicit and documented in `DECISIONS.md` (Phase 4) — never a
  magic constant. Never return a score without a non-empty evidence chain (the `PacketDecision`
  schema enforces this).

## Status
- **Done (Phase 0):** health + schema wiring.
- **Done (Phase 2):** `app/rules.py` cross-document rules engine + `POST /risk/rules/check`.
- **Done (Phase 3):** `app/features.py` (16-feature vector), `train.py` (Isolation Forest + GBC,
  joblib artifacts in `models/`), `app/scorer.py` inference wrapper.
- **Done (Phase 4):** `app/aggregator.py` (documented-weight blend → `TrustScore` + evidence chain +
  `Recommendation`) and `POST /risk/score` (main orchestration endpoint, Phase 1→4 in-process).
- **Done (Phase 5):** `app/graph.py` (`ApplicationGraph`: rings + double-financed-collateral clusters,
  hub suppression, pickle persistence) + `POST /risk/graph/upsert`, `GET /risk/graph/clusters`,
  `GET /risk/graph/subgraph/{id}`, and `use_graph` on `POST /risk/score`. Graph evidence folds into the
  score as an additive risk overlay (see DECISIONS.md). Graph store under `graph_store/` is gitignored.
- **Done (Phase 6–9):** dashboard demo endpoints, PII redaction, demo script, re-OCR/D3 overlays.
- **Done (Web app §8, v7.0.0):** `app/db.py` (SQLite users/cases — gitignored `app_data/`),
  `app/auth.py` (PBKDF2 + JWT; `/auth/register|login|me`; `current_user`/`require_admin`),
  `app/cases.py` (`POST /cases` upload→ingest→score→persist; `GET /cases`, `GET /cases/{id}`),
  `app/overlays.py` (shared tamper-overlay builder). Real uploads reuse `aggregator.score_packet_dir`
  with **neutralized velocity** features. Case files under `case_store/` are gitignored. Deps: PyJWT +
  python-multipart.
- **Done (Real-doc KYC + underwriting §9):** `app/profiles.py` (purpose → required document slots; one
  source of truth for completeness + the upload form, served at `GET /cases/profiles`),
  `app/underwriting.py` (completeness, KYC identity/address/name-consistency, income reconciliation,
  FOIR/affordability/LTV → ELIGIBLE/REFER/DECLINE — **documented constants**, no magic numbers),
  `aggregator.apply_verification` (folds completeness/KYC/income findings into the trust score by a
  **capped** penalty; eligibility stays OFF the trust axis). `POST /cases` now takes per-file
  `doc_types` slot hints + `tenure_months`/`existing_emi` and persists a `verification` block
  (`db._migrate` adds the columns). Authenticity (trust) and eligibility are **separate axes**.

## Scoring weights (Phase 4 — documented, never magic constants)
`aggregator.WEIGHTS`: model 0.55 / forensic 0.25 / semantic 0.15 / IF-anomaly 0.05 (sum 1.0).
Thresholds: approve ≥ 70, freeze < 40, CRITICAL caps trust at 25. A freeze requires concrete
document evidence — a model-only low score softens to manual_review + graph routing. See DECISIONS.md.
